Speaker 1  0:00  
Rubble. And I think that kind of plays into having, having it be professionally put, as opposed to it may be like document, or at least even for us. And then there's a few things that I think I can do. You want me to add anything from this meeting that maybe is an action item now that I'm looking at it. Do you have any meetings coming up? Or we

Speaker 2  0:32  
have a potential meeting on the 30th? But that might may or may not be like pushed back, depending on I

me  0:40  
depending on no we'll need to push that one back because of what we just found out from about Salvation Army and what they would be looking for. I think we would want to take some time to try to flesh out that feature and come up with a solid demo. So probably around the time we would be ready to follow up, follow back up with the other team we talked to today, we would be ready to talk to that guy too. So I all like,

Unknown Speaker  1:26  
next week, end of

me  1:29  
next week, we could aim for that. I think that would be ideal, because I'm I'm just the last thing I needed to do for the pitch deck is add everyone's like role in the company, so that it makes the most sense to like whoever looks at it and kind of go from there. Hold up. Hold on. For what? Well, you guys continue. I'll be right back. Okay. Hello.

me  2:11  
No, I'm good. The water just came back on here. So, yeah, the water is off most of the day. I

Unknown Speaker  3:37  
No, not yet, because of that. Okay,

Speaker 3  4:41  
it's all fair and you ain't gonna have to sleep, I don't want to get there. I got too long.

me  4:51  
Do you have to? Do you know your schedule? So do you know tomorrow early?

Speaker 3  4:59  
Okay, yes, apparently, you know, one kid wanted to be seen on Saturdays. I can't think I'm not doing that. And then she said, the same parent said something about 430 another parent hasn't gotten back to me. And then another parent's mind is a mark. Okay?

me  5:27  
Okay,

Unknown Speaker  5:37  
once I hit Dr, blue is going to be something like A work around, if that makes

Speaker 3  5:59  
sense. Yeah, only if folks, if only it was on for the Royal I had this one that is not well. I had one student, Glenda, ever I went to the school. I only went

Unknown Speaker  6:21  
there probably twice.

me  6:31  
Yeah, I'm just thinking

me  6:46  
the offer that they gave you, if you take it full time, maybe we should try to find something a little bit more east. Yeah, but I'm just saying still, see you don't know. I

Unknown Speaker  7:03  
i move like it happened.

me  7:06  
I know I'm just saying,

Unknown Speaker  7:20  
yeah, if that was the case, I mean the school, the actual school that I'd be working for was in around students are in different places. It's not like I would have this case. It

Speaker 3  7:53  
could be San Pedro. It could be different, as long as it's LA USD, okay. We're as far as where the areas,

Unknown Speaker  8:11  
because it's about availability. Like

me  8:34  
yeah, i

Unknown Speaker  8:46  
Song remain the same. Or do you want anything?

me  8:50  
I'm good. Grab what you want so you can go to sleep full. She'll have a long day tomorrow. So what?

me  9:05  
Yeah, for today? No, she seemed to do fine, skipping at 3am and you're right, she's gaining weight. I think I'm just a little anxious.

Speaker 3  9:22  
She feels heavier, and she looks good. She looks bigger too.

me  9:26  
Yeah, her head is definitely

Speaker 3  9:30  
bigger. Yeah, how small? How small was it?

me  9:38  
It looked like a I couldn't get it around the back of her head, like It just kept popping up. Like, hey, Arnold,

Unknown Speaker  9:46  
hilarious. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  10:04  
I could do this journey right now that way.

me  10:12  
Oh yeah, cuz you'll be out by then. Yeah, you can go ahead and do it. You

me  10:24  
Yeah,

Speaker 3  10:35  
if you want me to wait, is she, you know how she gets her like, I feel like, you guys, I feel like she's like, being fed around four anyway, so I can wait till four or whatever. You know what I'm saying, because

me  10:50  
you could do it at three, or you could do that three. Or, you know what I'm trying to say, three or four. Yeah, either one

Speaker 3  11:01  
I'm saying also for your schedule, if you don't want to get up properly,

me  11:09  
no, usually if she goes back to sleep, I can stretch it out like an extra hour. So that's what I'm saying. Like it's literally up to you. Okay, we just as long as she we just leave her sleep when she goes to sleep.

me  11:39  
Yeah, me too, because

Unknown Speaker  11:43  
yeah, I can

Unknown Speaker  11:53  
let you hop in. I'm sorry real quick, and then I can happen, since you haven't been able to even wash your hands on,

me  13:51  
Yeah, it happens.

Speaker 3  13:53  
I mean, it's almost like one. I mean, especially when they get a little older, they're gonna get you sick. I

me  14:14  
Yeah, but yeah, breast milk, if like, your body will add more antibodies with the baby sick. So it's probably why it wasn't Yeah, like, a response, yeah. Like, it also your breast milk during the daytime will keep them more alert, and at night, it'll make them more sleepy. Like it literally changes for whatever your baby needs,

Speaker 3  14:46  
yeah, probably what you need because you're you're filming, yeah, if you're tired, everybody's wagging up at night, your body is responding to this. That's probably what we need to Yeah, I Here
